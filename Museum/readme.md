## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

I will be creating a web app based on the bear claw necklace in which will showcase a sacred Bear Claw Necklace from the Lakota Sioux Nation, dated to the late 1800s. Through interactive design, storytelling, and multimedia elements, users explore the cultural, spiritual, and historical significance of this powerful symbol of warriorhood and resilience.

### Core Webpages

1. Home Page: “Introduction to the Bear Claw Necklace”
   Hero image: Fullscreen image or 3D render of the necklace
   Welcome text and short artifact summary
   The story followed by a call-to-action button

2. Artifact Page:
   360° interactive viewer of the necklace (rotate/zoom)
   Clickable hotspots on beads, claws, and cords with cultural context popups
   Short videos or audio clips explaining traditional materials and craftsmanship

3. Story Page:
   Scroll-triggered animation
   Follows a young Lakota warrior's symbolic journey to earn and wear the necklace
   Integrates real historical context and traditions

4. Timeline Page:
   Visual timeline tracing the role of warriors, the impact of U.S. expansion, and modern Indigenous activism

Highlight how the necklace tradition has evolved or been preserved
